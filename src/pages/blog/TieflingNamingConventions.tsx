            <p>
              According to the Player's Handbook (2014), tieflings often choose names that fall into three distinct categories: virtue names, infernal heritage names, and adopted cultural names. Research by D&D Beyond's player statistics in 2023 shows that approximately 45% of players choose virtue-based names for their tiefling characters, highlighting the enduring popularity of this naming convention.
