            </p>

            <h2>Embrace the Infernal Heritage</h2>
            <p>
              Tieflings are defined by their infernal heritage, which manifests in their physical appearance and sometimes 
              in their innate abilities. Consider how your character feels about their lineage. Do they embrace it, 
              reject it, or try to find a balance?
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Infernal Pacts:</strong> Explore the history of the pact that led to your character's tiefling heritage. 
                Was it a deal made by their ancestors, or is it a more recent event?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Physical Traits:</strong> Use your character's physical traits to inform their personality. Do their horns 
                make them feel like a monster, or do they see them as a symbol of power?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Infernal Magic:</strong> Consider how your character's infernal magic influences their behavior. Do they 
                use it for good, or are they tempted by its darker potential?
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Play the Outsider</h2>
            <p>
              Tieflings are often treated as outsiders, feared and distrusted by others. This can lead to feelings of 
              isolation, resentment, or a desire to prove themselves.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Social Interactions:</strong> Pay attention to how your character interacts with others. Do they try to 
                fit in, or do they embrace their outsider status?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Prejudice:</strong> Consider how your character deals with prejudice. Do they respond with anger, sadness, 
                or a determination to change people's perceptions?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Finding Acceptance:</strong> Explore how your character seeks acceptance. Do they find it in a community of 
                other outcasts, or do they try to earn the respect of those who fear them?
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Develop a Strong Backstory</h2>
            <p>
              A well-developed backstory can add depth and complexity to your tiefling character. Consider their upbringing, 
              their relationships, and the events that shaped their personality.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Family:</strong> Explore your character's relationship with their family. Were they raised by loving parents, 
                or were they abandoned because of their tiefling heritage?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Mentors:</strong> Consider who has guided your character. Did they have a mentor who taught them how to 
                use their infernal magic, or did they learn to survive on their own?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Motivations:</strong> Define your character's goals and motivations. What do they want to achieve, and why?
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Embrace the Inner Conflict</h2>
            <p>
              Tieflings often struggle with inner conflict, torn between their infernal heritage and their desire for acceptance. 
              This can lead to interesting roleplaying opportunities as your character grapples with their identity.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Moral Dilemmas:</strong> Explore moral dilemmas that challenge your character's values. Do they choose the 
                path of good, even when it's difficult, or do they give in to their darker impulses?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Redemption:</strong> Consider whether your character seeks redemption. Do they try to atone for the sins of 
                their ancestors, or do they believe they are destined to be evil?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Self-Acceptance:</strong> Explore how your character learns to accept themselves, flaws and all. Do they 
                find peace in embracing their tiefling heritage, or do they continue to struggle with their identity?
              </li>
            </ul>
